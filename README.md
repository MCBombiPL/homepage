# Brief description

It's a homework I did during my educational process at YouCode coding school so far. This page was created using basic html tags, adding styles (CSS), using navigation, tables, user interactions (mostly buttons). I hope it develops soon - just have to learn more front-end development techniques. Can't wait!

Done using:

- HTML,
- CSS,
- JS,
- MD,
- BEM convention
